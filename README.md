# Prospective-Kernel-density-estimation-method-for-crime-hotspot-prediction

This repo. contains code for generating predictive hotspots of crime based on Kernel density algorithm. The algorithm use a historic record of crime of the previous 60-90 days and model the hotspot on a square grid system overlayed on a study area.
